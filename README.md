# RandomWalk
Woohoo, my first repository. This is a simple random walk python program using matplotlib. You can change parameters according to your own choice. Some parameters need to change in proportion with other parameters (like "s" in plt.scatter() should change according to "steps") but I'm too lazy to do it now, lol.
